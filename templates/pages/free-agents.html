<span class="help-icon" data-title="Free Agent help" data-text="This page shows available players on Waivers, and Free Agency, updated when db is updated, with last update timestamp shown on this page. The stat table shows a ranking of how that player projects in a given stat based on percentile of the league as a whole. A 1 in a category means they project to be in the top 5% of the league in that stat, a 20 indicates they are bottom 25%. If you see a player with no values, they currently do not have projections, DB Projections will be updated throughout the year to correct missing players. The checkboxes will adjust how the final ranking is determined. Unchecking any box will reduce the impact of that stat projection in the final ranking and ordering of free agents, uncheck any box for a stat that you are not concerned with for the given week to pinpoint players that better your category needs for the week. Unused Roster Spots shows the days of the week where you have open positions. A 0* means the optimal lineup has that position full but with a flexible position player who could move to another spot, so that position may still be available.">?</span>
